## ðŸš€ The Project
This project was developed over a three-week period as the final assignment of my 100-day Frontend Developer program at Lexicon.  
The goal was to build a custom WordPress theme based on the Underscores starter theme and bring a Figma design to life as a fully functional website.  

The site dynamically displays information about movies and TV series using data fetched from the TMDB API.
