## ðŸš€ The Project
This project is the final task of my 100-day Frontend Developer education at Lexicon. The goal was to make a custom WordPress theme based on the Underscores starter theme. Besides, bring a Figma design to life as a working template for the website.

The site dynamically shows info about movies and TV series using data fetched from the TMDB API. In the local database, I've created a table to display movies and TV series data on the frontend.
