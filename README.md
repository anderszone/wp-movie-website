## 🚀 The Project
This project is the final task of my 100-day Frontend Developer education at Lexicon. The goal was to make a custom WordPress theme based on the Underscores starter theme. Besides, bring a Figma design to life as a working template for the website.  

The site dynamically displays info about movies and TV shows using data fetched from the TMDB API. In the local database, I've created a table to show film and TV series data on the frontend for visitors.

You will also find a section for films and TV shows, organized by genre.

🔗 **Live site:** [https://anderswebb.se](https://anderswebb.se)
